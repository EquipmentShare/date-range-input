		Suppositions:
		<ul>
			<li>Clicking and dragging creates a new range rather than modifying the existing range</li>
			<li>Needing to select a single day range is a very uncommon use case</li>
			<li>The left calendar is the "start" and the right calendar is the "end"</li>
			<li>
				Users changing the "end" calendar to show a month before the "start" calendar will not happen very often
				<ul>
					<li>Trying to prevent it from happening would make the picker frustrating to people who were in the middle of adjusting both calendars</li>
					<li>it's more important that the picker behave consistently than it is to try to make the UX super-intuitive in that state</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
